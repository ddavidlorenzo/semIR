Title: Democracy in America  -- (Score: 0.4768) (Goodreads Id: 16619)
Authors: Alexis de Tocqueville, Isaac Kramnick, Gerald Bevan
Overview: Democracy in America has had the singular honor of being even to this day the work that political commentators of every stripe refer to when they seek to draw large conclusions about the society of the USA. Alexis de Tocqueville, a young French aristocrat, came to the young nation to investigate the functioning of American democracy & the social, political & economic life of its citizens, publishing his observations in 1835 & 1840. Brilliantly written, vividly illustrated with vignettes & portraits, Democracy in America is far more than a trenchant analysis of one society at a particular point in time. What will most intrigue modern readers is how many of the observations still hold true: on the mixed advantages of a free press, the strained relations among the races & the threats posed to democracies by consumerism & corruption. So uncanny is Tocqueville’s insight & so accurate are his predictions, that it seems as tho he were not merely describing the American identity but actually helping to create it.

Both heavily influenced by and critical of Plato's Republic and Laws, Politics represents the distillation of a lifetime of thought and observation. Encyclopaedic knowledge has never, before or since, gone hand in hand with a logic so masculine or with speculation so profound, says H. W. C. Davis in his introduction.

King disagrees: My deeply held conviction is that story must be paramount...All other considerations are 2ndary theme, mood, even characterization & language. These fine stories, each written in what King calls a burst of faith, happiness & optimism, prove his point. The theme, mood, characters & language vary, but throughout, a sense of story reigns supreme. Nightmares & Dreamscapes contains 20 short tales including several never before published plus one teleplay, one poem & one nonfiction piece about kids & baseball that appeared in the New Yorker. The subjects include vampires, zombies, an evil toy, man-eating frogs, the burial of a Cadillac, a disembodied finger & a wicked stepfather. The style ranges from King's well-honed horror to a Ray Bradbury-like fantasy voice to an ambitious pastiche of Raymond Chandler & Ross MacDonald. And like a compact disc with a bonus track, the book ends with a charming little tale not listed in the table of contents a parable called The Beggar & the Diamond. Fiona Webster
